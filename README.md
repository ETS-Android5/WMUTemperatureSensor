A React-native-ble-plx BLE application. Polidea rocks!

What does it do: Reads temperature data from the manufacture data broadcasted from a ble device.

Why is it special: Connectionless based data transfer! Utilizes very very low power on transmitting side. Great for sensor nodes!

V1.0 was first ever published mobile app (android only) to a store. Development time was extremely short and split between application and device so react native was perfect for a simple solution to cross plat! Hopefully other makers will start using this type of data transfer more often in projects.

Bottleneck of around 300ms update rate due to phone scan rate per android/ ios
